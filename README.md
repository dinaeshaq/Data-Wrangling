After downloading the twitter_archive_enhanced.CSV file. I visualized the file to check the data in the columns. 
I found some columns not needed such as retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id also I found other rows that most of them havens values 
such as in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id.
Next, I imported the needed libraries that will be used in the code. After uploaded the previous file, 
I downloaded the image predication file programmatically. Then I created the JSON file. This was the gathering stage I applied to get the data.
In the assessing stage, I checked each dataset of the three files, I found some issues and I fixed it.
